This repository contains an analysis of weather stations in Hawaii. The two main files - climate_starter.ipynb and app.py - query the SQLite database in the Resources folder - hawaii.sqlite - to complete the analysis.

## climate_starter.ipynb

This file uses Jupyter notebook to display the results of the Hawaii SQLite database queries performed via SQLAlchemy in Python.

## app.py

This Python file uses the Flask module to create an app allowing clients to request the results of various Hawaii weather queries in JSON form using several available paths.
